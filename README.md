The index.html is CoffeeOnline.html, that file alone has all of the external scripts to run the project.  
In addition, there is a dependence on the jquery library for some functionality

This project illustrates utilization of Javascript, HTML, CSS and the JQUERY library.  
The project integrates a mash of two API's; the Google Maps Geolocation API with OpenWeatherMap.
I hope you enjoy the show.
